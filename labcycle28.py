''' Write a class called Time whose only field is a time in seconds. It should have a method 
called convert_to_minutes that returns a string of minutes and seconds formatted as in the 
following example: if seconds is 230, the method should return '5:50'. It should also have a 
method called convert_to_hours that returns a string of hours, minutes, and seconds formatted 
analogously to the previous method. '''
