27) Write a class called Product. The class should have fields called name, amount, and 
price, holding the productâ€™s name, the number of items of that product in stock, and 
the regular price of the product. There should be a method get_price that receives the 
number of items to be bought and returns a the cost of buying that many items, where 
the regular price is charged for orders of less than 10 items, a 10% discount is applied 
for orders of between 10 and 99 items, and a 20% discount is applied for orders of 
100 or more items. There should also be a method called make_purchase that receives 
the number of items to be bought and decreases amount by that much.
