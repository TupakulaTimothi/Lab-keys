#  9) Write a program that asks the user to enter two strings of the same length.
#     The program should then check to see if the strings are of the same length. If they are not, 
#     the program should print an appropriate message and exit. If they are of the same length,
#     the program should alternate the characters of the two strings. For example, if 
#     the user enters abcde and ABCDE the program should print out AaBbCcDdEe.
